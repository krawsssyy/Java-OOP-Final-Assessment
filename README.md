# Java-OOP-Final-Assessment

This is my final assessment for the OOP in Java class. This program is a bit more complex than the other OOP projects I've had. It can work with file input and output or connect to a local SQLite database.
It also opens a dialog from and interacts with the user through it, displaying different aspects of using Swing for UI design.
